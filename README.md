## Description

Creating a porfolio as a web-developer is important, because the website itself showcases the technical skills learned, as well as providing a unique space to showcase all of the projects that have been completed! My portfolio is a reflection of my coding journey, and has evolved greatly from the first revision. In order to make several changes, I used "React"! Visit my [portfolio](https://amylipscomb.github.io/portfolio-react/) and enjoy!

## Installation

After setting up my repo, the first action item I tackled was installing what was necessary. I typed the following into the command line:
```
 npm create react-app portfolio
 ```

This line installed React, and created the folder "Portfolio". I had to create an application folder, because React needs one in order to import the necessary files. This folder created the public folder, src folder, and package.json files. Then after it was made, I copied the files that were created, pasted the information outside of the folder, and then deleted it. 

To eventually deploy my portfolio via GitHub Pages, I had to import github pages. I did this by typing the following into the command line:

```
npm i gh-pages
```

## Usage


```
npm run build
```

Then to start the server, I typed the following command:
```
npm start
```
<!-- Below is what appears in the terminal, when the code works properly.

![npmrunbuild](./Assets/npmrunbuild.png)

After I did that, the "dist" folder was created within the "client". Within the "dist" folder, several files were created as well, including an index.html, install.bundle.js, main.bundle.js, manifest.json, and a src-sw.js.
